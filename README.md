> > ► How to setup and configure? ◄
> - You will need the program (OPENIV)
> - With OPENIV you will need to locate the colored menu in this YTD
> - Then you want to customize it yourself
> - Lastly you need to put it in a stream folder with a resource.lua outside of the stream folder and start up your server with the ytd started!
