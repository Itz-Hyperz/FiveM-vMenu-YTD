# vMenu-YTD
This is the YTD you can use to replace your banner on your vMenu! vMenu was not made by me and I only am posting this to help people when it comes to adding something custom to their server!

► How to setup and configure? ◄
- You will need the program (OPENIV)
- With OPENIV you will need to locate the colored menu in this YTD
- Then you want to customize it yourself
- Lastly you need to put it in a stream folder with a resource.lua outside of the stream folder and start up your server with the ytd started!
